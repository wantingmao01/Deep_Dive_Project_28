# Deep Dive Project: UIUC GPA
Group Member: Wenqi Jia, Wanting Mao, Tianyun Yuan, Max Xu

## Problem
The project aims to leverage deep learning models to predict student average GPA for a certain course based on the student historical performance data. Our dataset includes detailed information on various courses including their year, term, course title, section, course num, main instructor and the score distribution of students. Using this data our goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the GPA of a course given specific attributes like instructor, subject, course number, year and term.
